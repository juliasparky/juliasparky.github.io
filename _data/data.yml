    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My focus is on providing first-class consultancy, using my background in tech and business.
      Apart from solid technical background in classic developer and devops roles, I have experience in several big migrations of critical infrastructure, have trained small to large teams.
      I am able to speed up cultural transformation, can tackle, analyse and break-down high-level roadmap items, as well as advise on best practices in tech, compliance and security. 
      Where required, I can train teams to help them cross technological barriers faster and at the same speed for all team members.
    
      I’m very well aware of a huge gap between desire for faster yet controllable change at management level and actually having that agility within teams. 
      The gap that is caused by tech or communication barriers, legacy toolset, isolated knowledge islands, regulations, process inertia and so on. 
      I can shorten that gap for your particular case, advise on how to tackle it or kickoff the transformation myself.
      The most important in crossing that gap for me is to maintain business continuity and steer the transformation in controllable way.
      Open for on-site and remote contracts

          - I went on with ACI as a contractor on AHS project to introduce active-hotstandby cross-datacenter traffic switchover for production environment with over 300 peak tps
          - The project goal was to reduce customer-facing incident impact during major platform outages. In case of major incident in live processing datacenter, the automated solution is supposed to detect failure condition and switchover complete transaction processing to DR site.
          - My particular responsibility was two-fold: 
          1) to implement tooling for controlled manual and automated switchovers, and 
          2) monitoring solution coupled with rule engine, that would trigger switchover on particular predefined condition.
          - The tooling was implemented in Go and consists of CLI interface for various platform components to orchestrate switchover across platform components, and witness daemon for proactive monitoring and incident detection.
          - Part of witness daemon is a rule engine, that detects failure condition and performs automated failover if condition is met
